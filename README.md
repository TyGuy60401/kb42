# kb42
Split 42 key keyboard utilizing Redragon low profile keys

It is heavily inspired by the [Budgy](https://github.com/doesntfazer/Budgy)
while also being heavily influenced in design my the
[Cheapino](https://github.com/tompi/cheapino).

Build guides coming soon. Source code for the firmware for the keyboard can be found in my [qmk fork](https://github.com/TyGuy60401/qmk_firmware).
In the assets folder you can find some pics and the .uf2 firmware files that you can download to flash the board yourself without having to build
the entire qmk compilation suite. One of the firmware files is a via compatible version of the firmware for the keyboard, and the other uses a very
basic layout which is quite limited.
